This thesis focuses on ‘text as an instrument’ and aims to reveal the generic structure of written-to-be-spoken language within the discourse of politics.,"“To a grammarian, text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in many different ways. It can be explored from many different points of view. But we can distinguish two main angles of vision: one, focus on the text as an object in its own right; two, focus on the text as an instrument for finding out about something else. Focusing on text as an object, a grammarian will be asking questions such as: Why is it valued as it is? Focusing on text as instrument, the grammarian will be asking what the text reveals about the system of the language in which it is spoken or written.” Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 3) 1. Establishing the Study Halliday and Matthiessen above state that “text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in different ways” and this study adopts the same viewpoint: language is rich and it is full of meaning.","The study postulates that sub-genres exist within the genre of political discourse and can be revealed by investigating the generic structure of political Speeches. This study takes the standpoint that genre is “a staged, goal oriented, purposeful activity in which speakers engage as members of our culture” (Martin 1984: 25). It is further elaborated as “a staged, goal-oriented social process. Social, because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented, because we use genres to get things done; staged, because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals” (Martin & Rose 2007: 8). Sub-genre is interpreted as a genre belonging to an already established genre. And this study sees this corpus, the American presidential radio addresses, as a genre within political discourse and the data of this study as possible sub-genres of the radio address. In order to illustrate genre, the research examines the generic structure of such speeches and proposes a functional approach of analysing the thematic structure by way of Theme and Rheme, which is part of the textual metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004; Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004).",Introduction,AP1,This thesis focuses…,test_restricted.csv,"```json

The structure is fully integrated grammatically but functionally detached from propositional content - it operates at the meta-level to announce what the text does rather than conveying facts about political discourse. SCOPE ANALYSIS: The functional scope is unambiguously macro. Despite grammatical localization in one sentence, the expression operates across the entire thesis: (1) 'thesis' is a whole-document reference, (2) 'focuses' and 'aims' establish global research purposes that organize all sections, (3) the anticipatory reach extends through the complete document structure, (4) this appears in the conventional Introduction position for thesis-scope announcements. FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION: Level 1 - METADISCOURSE status is certain due to strong reflexivity (sufficient condition) plus removal test confirmation (discourse guidance lost, propositional content intact). Level 2 - INTERACTIVE function is clear: the expression organizes and guides readers through announcing text structure and purpose, rather than expressing stance or engaging interpersonally. Level 3 - FRAME MARKER type is prototypical: announces discourse boundaries and organization, orients readers to global research agenda, uses text-reflexive language and discourse verbs characteristic of framing, appears in conventional position for thesis-scope frame markers. CONTEXTUAL VALIDATION: Genre conventions strongly support this classification - thesis introductions prototypically contain such macro-scope frame markers to establish research scope. The expression follows theoretical positioning and precedes more specific claims about sub-genres, fitting the expected rhetorical structure. This is a clear, unambiguous case requiring no hedging or borderline consideration.""
