This thesis focuses on ‘text as an instrument’ and aims to reveal the generic structure of written-to-be-spoken language within the discourse of politics.,"“To a grammarian, text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in many different ways. It can be explored from many different points of view. But we can distinguish two main angles of vision: one, focus on the text as an object in its own right; two, focus on the text as an instrument for finding out about something else. Focusing on text as an object, a grammarian will be asking questions such as: Why is it valued as it is? Focusing on text as instrument, the grammarian will be asking what the text reveals about the system of the language in which it is spoken or written.” Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 3) 1. Establishing the Study Halliday and Matthiessen above state that “text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in different ways” and this study adopts the same viewpoint: language is rich and it is full of meaning.","The study postulates that sub-genres exist within the genre of political discourse and can be revealed by investigating the generic structure of political Speeches. This study takes the standpoint that genre is “a staged, goal oriented, purposeful activity in which speakers engage as members of our culture” (Martin 1984: 25). It is further elaborated as “a staged, goal-oriented social process. Social, because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented, because we use genres to get things done; staged, because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals” (Martin & Rose 2007: 8). Sub-genre is interpreted as a genre belonging to an already established genre. And this study sees this corpus, the American presidential radio addresses, as a genre within political discourse and the data of this study as possible sub-genres of the radio address. In order to illustrate genre, the research examines the generic structure of such speeches and proposes a functional approach of analysing the thematic structure by way of Theme and Rheme, which is part of the textual metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004; Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004).",Introduction,AP1,test_restricted.csv,"```json

The present study aims to fill this gap within studies of this particular genre.,"Since the address is delivered on Saturdays, they found that the Sunday press coverage diminished over this time period including the number of paragraphs citing the president. Meernik and Ault (2013) researched the radio address from the perspective of foreign policy. They argued presidents have the ability to manipulate the agenda of foreign policy and make more tactical choices by placing more attention on domestic issues within the radio address. Han (2006) looked into the radio address as an old medium combined with new strategies, thus comparing the addresses of Reagan and Clinton. Jones and Rowland (2009) analysed the thematic overviews of Reagan’s addresses and researched his rhetorical strategies and ideology. Research more from a language perspective, Oddo (2011) investigated ‘us’ versus ‘them’ through critical intertextual analysis (Thibault 1991), and compared the addresses of F.D. Roosevelt and G.W. Bush through their legitimization strategies, thus establishing that Bush was among many who misled the public into war. Oddo delved into the language of the addresses but did not contain any linguistic analysis especially not to mention from an SFL perspective. Moreover, Scacco (2011) analysed Obama’s radio address, but from a ritualistic rhetoric standpoint, and compared Obama’s addresses to that of Clinton’s to understand how they both projected their presidencies onto the public, again, not from a perspective of linguistics. Thus, there has been research on the radio address, but none from a strictly functional linguistic perspective.","The present study focuses on the Radio Addresses of President Barack Obama during his first term as President, 2009-2012. It concentrates on 4 different contexts of situations (repertoires) of the radio in order to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre: the economy (4 addresses); healthcare (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses). Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to context of situation and that it is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address.

"Below, Figure 1.1 visualises this:","Moreover, Scacco (2011) analysed Obama’s radio address, but from a ritualistic rhetoric standpoint, and compared Obama’s addresses to that of Clinton’s to understand how they both projected their presidencies onto the public, again, not from a perspective of linguistics. Thus, there has been research on the radio address, but none from a strictly functional linguistic perspective. The present study aims to fill this gap within studies of this particular genre. The present study focusses on the Radio Addresses of President Barack Obama during his first term as President, 2009-2012. It concentrates on 4 different contexts of situations (repertoires) of the radio in order to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre: the economy (4 addresses); 2 healthcare (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses). Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to context of situation and that it is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address.","Genre: American Presidential Radio Address Sub-Genres of the American Presidential Radio Address: The Economy Health Care Man-Inflicted Tragedy Christmas Figure 1.1: Demonstrating Genre to Sub-genre This introductory chapter will first explain the functions of language, politics and discourse.

Social activities encompass many diverse events both written and spoken, such as greetings, cards, service encounters, casual conversations, arguments, telephone enquiries, instructions, lectures, debates, plays, jokes, or games (Martin and Rose 2007: 8).",Introduction,AP1,test_restricted.csv,"```json

"Next, the main theoretical concepts of the study will be mapped out, from genre, cline of instantiation to context of situation.","It concentrates on 4 different contexts of situations (repertoires) of the radio in order to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre: the economy (4 addresses); healthcare (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses). Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to context of situation and that it is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address.

This includes the research questions, the data, the analytical tool, the prospective results and the importance of the study. Finally, the structure of the overall thesis will be explained. 1.2 The Function of Language, Politics, and Discourse The function and connection between language and any social activity is inherent, since “the nature of language has to be functional since language grows out of languaging and languaging itself is a form of social life” (Hasan 2001: 4). Social activities encompass many diverse events both written and spoken, such as greetings, cards, service encounters, casual conversations, arguments, telephone enquiries, instructions, lectures, debates, plays, jokes, or games (Martin and Rose 2007: 8). All types of social activities are related to different contexts of situations, and language is needed to communicate according to the various contexts. Thus, the construction of language is dependent on the context in which it was produced. Halliday (2009:56) explains that language provides the means by which we act as well as reflect on the environment.",Introduction,AP1,test_restricted.csv,"```json

Further, political discourse can be defined as discourse produced by actors or authors that commonly include politicians or political institutions (van Dijk 1997: 12).

Halliday (2009:56) explains that language provides the means by which we act as well as reflect on the environment.,"1.2 The Function of Language, Politics, and Discourse The function and connection between language and any social activity is inherent, since “the nature of language has to be functional since language grows out of languaging and languaging itself is a form of social life” (Hasan 2001: 4). Social activities encompass many diverse events both written and spoken, such as greetings, cards, service encounters, casual conversations, arguments, telephone enquiries, instructions, lectures, debates, plays, jokes, or games (Martin and Rose 2007: 8). All types of social activities are related to different contexts of situations, and language is needed to communicate according to the various contexts. Thus, the construction of language is dependent on the context in which it was produced.","Further, Hasan (2001: 8) maintains that context (of situation) is important in two ways, first in shaping language as a system and then highlighting language as a process. This study stresses the importance of language, grammar, and the construction thereof within the context of political discourse. The term discourse may be described as “anything beyond a clause” (Schiffrin et al 2001:1). De Beaugrande (Rankema 2004: 49-50) has identified seven criteria for textuality: (1) cohesion, (2) coherence, (3) intentionality, (4) acceptability, (5) informativeness, (6) situationailty, (7) intertextuality. Further, political discourse can be defined as discourse produced by actors or authors that commonly include politicians or political institutions (van Dijk 1997: 12). According to van Dijk (2008: 90), political discourse includes “members of more powerful social groups and institutions, and especially their leaders, have more or less exclusive access to and control over, one or more types of public discourse”.",Introduction,AP1,test_restricted.csv,"```json

"Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to context of situation.","Oddo delved into the language of the addresses but did not contain any linguistic analysis especially not to mention from an SFL perspective. Moreover, Scacco (2011) analysed Obama’s radio address, but from a ritualistic rhetoric standpoint, and compared Obama’s addresses to that of Clinton’s to understand how they both projected their presidencies onto the public, again, not from a perspective of linguistics. Thus, there has been research on the radio address, but none from a strictly functional linguistic perspective. The present study aims to fill this gap within studies of this particular genre. The present study focusses on the Radio Addresses of President Barack Obama during his first term as President, 2009-2012. It concentrates on 4 different contexts of situations (repertoires) of the radio in order to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre: the economy (4 addresses); healthcare (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses).","It is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address. Below, Figure 1.1 visualises this: Genre: American Presidential Radio Address Sub-Genres of the American Presidential Radio Address: The Economy Health Care Man-Inflicted Tragedy Christmas Figure 1.1: Demonstrating Genre to Sub-genre This introductory chapter will first explain the functions of language, politics and discourse. Secondly, it will state reasons for studying the grammar of political discourse. Next, the main theoretical concepts of the study will be mapped out, from genre, cline of instantiation to context of situation. Fourth, the overall research objective will be addressed. This includes the research questions, the data, the analytical tool, the prospective results and the importance of the study.

It is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address.,"1.2 The Function of Language, Politics, and Discourse The function and connection between language and any social activity is inherent, since “the nature of language has to be functional since language grows out of languaging and languaging itself is a form of social life” (Hasan 2001: 4). Social activities encompass many diverse events both written and spoken, such as greetings, cards, service encounters, casual conversations, arguments, telephone enquiries, instructions, lectures, debates, plays, jokes, or games (Martin and Rose 2007: 8). All types of social activities are related to different contexts of situations, and language is needed to communicate according to the various contexts. Thus, the construction of language is dependent on the context in which it was produced. Halliday (2009:56) explains that language provides the means by which we act as well as reflect on the environment. Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to context of situation.","Below, Figure 1.1 visualises this: Genre: American Presidential Radio Address Sub-Genres of the American Presidential Radio Address: The Economy Health Care Man-Inflicted Tragedy Christmas Figure 1.1: Demonstrating Genre to Sub-genre This introductory chapter will first explain the functions of language, politics and discourse. Secondly, it will state reasons for studying the grammar of political discourse. Next, the main theoretical concepts of the study will be mapped out, from genre, cline of instantiation to context of situation. Fourth, the overall research objective will be addressed. This includes the research questions, the data, the analytical tool, the prospective results and the importance of the study.

"The vocabulary size of EPA Diacorpus and its sections was derived using a program suite largely acknowledged in linguistics, WordSmith Tools 5 (Scott 2007).","In view of the findings of the preliminary analysis, it was stipulated to concentrate the exploration of the EPA Diacorpus on two main linguistic aspects: diachronic lexical variation and diachronic structural variation, to be carried out, respectively, in chapter 8 and 9 of this thesis. With regard to the organization of this chapter, in the following section (7.1) the results of the preliminary analysis are reported. More specifically, an overview of general statistics concerning  the EPA Diacorpus is provided in sub-section 7.1.1,  along with a brief interpretation of them, while an account of the procedures followed for the pilot study and related results are provided in sub-section 7.1.2. Section 7.3 describes the methods applied to identify lexical items worth of interest in terms of diachronic lexical variation within the corpus and the subsequent procedures used to analyse them. Eventually, the methodologies taken into account to detect the diachronic structural development of EPAs are described in section 7.4. 7.1 Preliminary analysis 7.1.1 EPA Diacorpus: general statistics Information regarding vocabulary size, as well as the distribution of words, is very important when exploring corpora.","A first bunch of statistics extracted from the EPA Diacorpus is provided by the following table (tab.7.1). The columns respectively report: the number of EPAs, the number of tokens, the number of word types, TTR values, STTR values, and mean sentence length expressed in number of words. Horizontally reading, values are distinguished according to the provenance of EPAs – US and UK – and periods – 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 –.

Tokens simply denote all the running words of a spoken or written text and if a specific word form occurs more often, these occurrences are counted as well. Conversely, a word type is a single word form; when counting types, therefore, multiple occurrences are not taken into consideration.

A first bunch of statistics extracted from the EPA Diacorpus is provided by the following table (tab.7.1).,"With regard to the organization of this chapter, in the following section (7.1) the results of the preliminary analysis are reported. More specifically, an overview of general statistics concerning the EPA Diacorpus is provided in sub-section 7.1.1, along with a brief interpretation of them, while an account of the procedures followed for the pilot study and related results are provided in sub-section 7.1.2. Section 7.3 describes the methods applied to identify lexical items worth of interest in terms of diachronic lexical variation within the corpus and the subsequent procedures used to analyse them. Eventually, the methodologies taken into account to detect the diachronic structural development of EPAs are described in section 7.4.7.1 Preliminary analysis 7.1.1 EPA Diacorpus: general statistics Information regarding vocabulary size, as well as the distribution of words, is very important when exploring corpora. The vocabulary size of EPA Diacorpus and its sections was derived using a program suite largely acknowledged in linguistics, WordSmith Tools 5 (Scott 2007).","The columns respectively report: the number of EPAs, the number of tokens, the number of word types, TTR values, STTR values, and mean sentence length expressed in number of words. Horizontally reading, values are distinguished according to the provenance of EPAs – US and UK – and periods – 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 –. EPA Diacorpus - General Statistics Tab. 7.1 - EPA Diacorpus: general statistics (1) As shown by table 7.1, the EPA Diacorpus amounts to 299,138 tokens and 20,384 word types. Tokens simply denote all the running words of a spoken or written text and if a specific word form occurs more often, these occurrences are counted as well. Conversely, a word type is a single word form; when counting types, therefore, multiple occurrences are not taken into consideration. In order to gain more information about the vocabulary variation, the ratio of different word types to tokens, also called type/token ratio (TTR), has also been calculated.",Method,AP2,test_restricted.csv,"```json

"But while American EPA writers are wordier, their British colleagues seem to employ longer sentences in comparison (+3.2 words).","This indicates that there are at least 44 word types in every 1000 words of the EPA Diacorpus.In order to provide a term of comparison, we can recall, for instance, that the STTR in the FLOB corpus of British English, which contains a range of written texts from different genres, is 45.53. This result suggests that the EPA Diacorpus comprises a significant variety of words, not far from that of FLOB. Eventually, the mean sentence length of the corpus was calculated, which is 21.04. This value is based on a count that identifies sentences as a “full-stop, question-mark or exclamation-mark [...] immediately followed by one or more word separators and then a capital letter in the current language, a number or a currency symbol “ (Scott 2007). Considering the EPA Diacorpus in its whole extension, table 7.1 highlights a difference in terms of length between American and British EPAs, covering respectively 60% (180,375 tokens) and 40% (118,763 tokens) of the overall tokens, despite texts are almost equally distributed across both areas (187 American and 191 British EPAs).","With regard to the lexical variety, expressed by STTR, both components of the corpora show relevant values (44.41 and 43.41 respectively for American and British EPAs). From a diachronic perspective, EPAs have become not only longer but also more syntactically developed and lexically richer over time: their length has more than doubled, from about 40 thousand tokens in the 1950s to more than 80 thousand tokens in the 2000s. Also the number of words used in each sentence, which went from 19.33 in the 1950s to 22.77 in the 2000s (+ 3.44), and the lexical variety, which went from 42.35 to 44.8 ( +2.45), have increased. Exploring the decades, at least two periods seem to be particularly relevant in terms of change and worth of further investigation: between the 1960s and the 1970s, when the value of STTR shrinks down, quiet unexpectedly, from 43.72 to 41.5, and between the 1970s and the 1980s, when, on the contrary, a rapid growth is evidenced, from 41.5 and 44.3.",Method,AP2,test_restricted.csv,"```json
