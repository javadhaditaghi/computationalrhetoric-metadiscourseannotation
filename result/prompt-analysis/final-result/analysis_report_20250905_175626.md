## Analysis Results

### Detailed Analysis Report

#### 1. Identification of Specific Weaknesses in the Current Prompt

- **Ambiguity in Definitions**: The current definitions of "Metadiscourse" and "Propositional" are not sufficiently distinct, leading to confusion, especially in cases of dual functionality.
- **Insufficient Guidance on Dual Functions**: The prompt lacks clear instructions on how to handle expressions that serve both metadiscursive and propositional roles, leading to frequent use of the "Borderline" category.
- **Contextual Analysis**: The prompt does not adequately emphasize the importance of context in determining the primary function of an expression, which is crucial for accurate classification.
- **Over-reliance on Borderline Category**: The guidelines suggest using the "Borderline" category but do not provide enough criteria to distinguish when it is appropriate, leading to inconsistent use.
- **Lack of Examples**: There is a lack of concrete examples illustrating how to classify expressions with dual functions, which could help annotators make more consistent decisions.

#### 2. Analysis of Patterns in the Discrepancy Data

- **Dual Functionality**: A significant number of discrepancies arise from expressions that serve both metadiscursive and propositional functions, such as "demonstrates that" and "seem to."
- **Boundary Confusion**: There is frequent confusion about the boundaries between metadiscourse and propositional content, especially when expressions are embedded in sentences with mixed functions.
- **Role of Citations**: Disagreements often occur in the classification of citations, with some models viewing them as metadiscourse and others as propositional.

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Annotation Inconsistencies

- **Interpretive Variability**: Different models interpret the same expression differently due to vague guidelines, especially regarding dual functions and the role of context.
- **Lack of Contextual Emphasis**: Insufficient emphasis on the role of context in determining the function of an expression leads to inconsistent classifications.
- **Inadequate Training on Dual Functions**: Annotators are not adequately trained to recognize and handle expressions with dual functions, leading to overuse of the "Borderline" category.

#### 4. Concrete, Actionable Recommendations for Improvement

- **Clarify Definitions**: Refine the definitions of "Metadiscourse" and "Propositional" to emphasize their distinct roles and provide clear criteria for classification.
- **Enhance Dual Function Guidelines**: Provide detailed guidelines and examples for handling expressions with dual functions, including when to use the "Borderline" category.
- **Emphasize Contextual Analysis**: Strengthen the emphasis on contextual analysis, instructing annotators to consider both local and global discourse functions.
- **Provide Examples**: Include a variety of examples illustrating how to classify expressions with dual functions and how to handle borderline cases.
- **Refine Confidence Scoring**: Encourage annotators to use the confidence score to reflect uncertainty rather than defaulting to the "Borderline" category.

#### 5. Priority Areas that Need Immediate Attention

- **Dual Functionality Handling**: Immediate clarification and examples are needed for expressions with dual functions to reduce reliance on the "Borderline" category.
- **Contextual Emphasis**: Revise the prompt to better integrate contextual analysis into the classification process.
- **Role of Citations**: Provide specific guidelines on how to classify citations in different contexts to reduce discrepancies.

#### 6. Specific Examples of How Instructions Should Be Clarified

- **Example for Dual Functionality**: "For expressions like 'demonstrates that,' consider whether the primary role is to introduce a factual claim (Propositional) or to guide reader interpretation (Metadiscourse). Use 'Borderline' only if both roles are equally prominent."
- **Contextual Analysis Example**: "When classifying 'Eventually,' assess whether it primarily serves to organize the text (Metadiscourse) or is part of a factual statement (Propositional). Consider the surrounding context to determine its primary function."
- **Citations Example**: "In a methods section, citations often serve a propositional function by providing factual information about the methodology. In contrast, in a discussion section, they may serve a metadiscursive function by framing the argument."

By addressing these areas, the revised prompt can provide clearer, more precise guidelines that reduce ambiguity and improve consistency across annotators.
