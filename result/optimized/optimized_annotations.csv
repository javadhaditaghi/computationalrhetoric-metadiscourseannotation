```","And this study sees this corpus, the American presidential radio addresses, as a genre within political discourse and the data of this study as possible sub-genres of the radio address. In order to illustrate genre, the research examines the generic structure of such speeches and proposes a functional approach of analysing the thematic structure by way of Theme and Rheme, which is part of the textual metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004; Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004). In order to study the goal, social purpose and generic structure of written-to-be-spoken language of political discourse, study investigates the genre of the American Presidential radio address by way of a Thematic structure analysis. The radio address is its own genre within political discourse and it is embedded in the context of American culture.","The radio address thus is realised, operates and has expected functions within the context of an American president and Americans are familiar with the radio address due to its long history and tradition. There has been research on the presidential weekly radio address, but there is a gap of linguistic investigation of this genre. Martin (1984) researched Reagan’s return to the radio address, he revealed that Reagan felt other forms of communication, such a news conferences, were more restrictive and thus Reagan felt he was able to speak freely and be publically more present. Horvit, Schiffer, and Wright (2008) investigated the Sunday press coverage of the radio address from 1982 to 2005. Since the address is delivered on Saturdays, they found that the Sunday press coverage diminished over this time period including the number of paragraphs citing the president. Meernik and Ault (2013) researched the radio address from the perspective of foreign policy.","{""thesis_code"": ""AP1"", ""section"": ""Introduction"", ""expr_1"": ""Scacci (2011) states"", ""expr_2"": null, ""expr_3"": null, ""ctx"": ""The radio address thus is realised, operates and has expected functions within the context of an American president and Americans are familiar with the radio address due to its long...

```","Since the address is delivered on Saturdays, they found that the Sunday press coverage diminished over this time period including the number of paragraphs citing the president. Meernik and Ault (2013) researched the radio address from the perspective of foreign policy. They argued presidents have the ability to manipulate the agenda of foreign policy and make more tactical choices by placing more attention on domestic issues within the radio address. Han (2006) looked into the radio address as an old medium combined with new strategies, thus comparing the addresses of Reagan and Clinton. Jones and Rowland (2009) analysed the thematic overviews of Reagan’s addresses and researched his rhetorical strategies and ideology. Research more from a language perspective, Oddo (2011) investigated ‘us’ versus ‘them’ through critical intertextual analysis (Thibault 1991), and compared the addresses of F.D. Roosevelt and G.W. Bush through their legitimization strategies, thus establishing that Bush was among many who misled the public into war. Oddo delved into the language of the addresses but did not contain any linguistic analysis especially not to mention from an SFL perspective. Moreover, Scacco (2011) analysed Obama’s radio address, but from a ritualistic rhetoric standpoint, and compared Obama’s addresses to that of Clinton’s to understand how they both projected their presidencies onto the public, again, not from a perspective of linguistics. Thus, there has been research on the radio address, but none from a strictly functional linguistic perspective.","The present study focuses on the Radio Addresses of President Barack Obama during his first term as President, 2009-2012. It concentrates on 4 different contexts of situations (repertoires) of the radio in order to investigate the possibility of sub-genres within this genre: the economy (4 addresses); healthcare (4 addresses); man-inflicted tragedies (4 addresses); and Christmas (4 addresses). Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the generic structures of these addresses do vary according to context of situation and that it is possible to establish a sub-genre within the Radio Address.

```","“To a grammarian, text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in many different ways.It can be explored from many different points of view. But we can distinguish two main angles of vision: one, focus on the text as an object in its own right; two, focus on the text as an instrument for finding out about something else. Focusing on text as an object, a grammarian will be asking questions such as: Why is it valued as it is? Focusing on text as instrument, the grammarian will be asking what the text reveals about the system of the language in which it is spoken or written.” Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 3) 1. Establishing the Study Halliday and Matthiessen above state that “text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in different ways” and this study adopts the same viewpoint: language is rich and it is full of meaning. This thesis focuses on ‘text as an instrument’ and aims to reveal the generic structure of written-to-be-spoken language within the discourse of politics. The study postulates that sub-genres exist within the genre of political discourse and can be revealed by investigating the generic structure of political speeches.","It is further elaborated as “a staged, goal-oriented social process. Social, because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented, because we use genres to get things done; staged, because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals” (Martin & Rose 2007: 8). Sub-genre is interpreted as a genre belonging to an already established genre. And this study sees this corpus, the American presidential radio addresses, as a genre within political discourse and the data of this study as possible sub-genres of the radio address. In order to illustrate genre, the research examines the generic structure of such speeches and proposes a functional approach of analysing the thematic structure by way of Theme and Rheme, which is part of the textual metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004; Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004).","{""thesis_code"": ""AP1"", ""section"": ""Introduction"", ""expr_1"": ""This study takes the standpoint that"", ""expr_2"": null, ""expr_3"": null, ""ctx"": ""Following a discussion of Halliday and Matthiessen\u2019s view that text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon and that genre is a staged, goal-oriented social process, the introduction states: Halliday and Matthiessen above state that \u201ctext is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that \u2018means\u2019 in different ways\u201d and this study adopts the same viewpoint.

```","“To a grammarian, text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in many different ways. It can be explored from many different points of view. But we can distinguish two main angles of vision: one, focus on the text as an object in its own right; two, focus on the text as an instrument for finding out about something else. Focusing on text as an object, a grammarian will be asking questions such as: Why is it valued as it is? Focusing on text as instrument, the grammarian will be asking what the text reveals about the system of the language in which it is spoken or written.” Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 3) 1. Establishing the Study Halliday and Matthiessen above state that “text is a rich, many-faceted phenomenon that ‘means’ in different ways” and this study adopts the same viewpoint: language is rich and it is full of meaning.","The study postulates that sub-genres exist within the genre of political discourse and can be revealed by investigating the generic structure of political Speeches. This study takes the standpoint that genre is “a staged, goal oriented, purposeful activity in which speakers engage as members of our culture” (Martin 1984: 25). It is further elaborated as “a staged, goal-oriented social process. Social, because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented, because we use genres to get things done; staged, because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals” (Martin & Rose 2007: 8). Sub-genre is interpreted as a genre belonging to an already established genre. And this study sees this corpus, the American presidential radio addresses, as a genre within political discourse and the data of this study as possible sub-genres of the radio address. In order to illustrate genre, the research examines the generic structure of such speeches and proposes a functional approach of analysing the thematic structure by way of Theme and Rheme, which is part of the textual metafunction of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004; Eggins 2004; Thompson 2004).","{""thesis_code"": ""AP1"", ""section"": ""Introduction"", ""expr_1"": ""This thesis focuses on"", ""expr_2"": ""and aims"", ""expr_3"": null, ""ctx"": ""The study postulates that sub-genres exist within the genre of political discourse and can be revealed by investigating the generic structure of political speeches.
