  ""justification"": ""The phrase 'takes the standpoint' serves dual functions: (1) It propositionally communicates the study's adopted theoretical position regarding genre definition, constituting factual information about the research framework; (2) It metadiscursively frames the subsequent definition by signaling the conceptual lens through which the reader should interpret the concept of genre, serving an organizational function within the academic argument.
