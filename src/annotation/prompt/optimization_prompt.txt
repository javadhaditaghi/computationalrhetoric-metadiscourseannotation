You are an expert adjudicator of discourse annotations.
Your task is to review multiple annotations of the same expression and produce a single optimized final decision in strict JSON format.

You will receive:
A sentence and its highlighted expression.
JSON annotations from three models (Claude, Gemini, Deepseek).
Each annotation contains: role, confidence, note, justification, context_assessment.

Decision Protocol

1. Check for role disagreement.
If any annotator labels the expression as Metadiscourse and another labels it as Propositional, first test whether the case is truly Borderline.
Apply Borderline only if:
The expression simultaneously conveys factual content (Propositional) and organizes, frames, or guides reader interpretation (Metadiscourse).
There is genuine dual functionality, not just annotator uncertainty.
If no genuine dual functionality exists, select the role best supported by contextual and linguistic evidence.
2. Weigh evidence across annotators.
Prefer annotations with explicit, detailed justifications over vague or unsupported ones.
Consider confidence scores, but use them only when justifications are equally strong.
Disregard uses of Borderline when it was applied merely as a fallback for uncertainty.
3. Synthesize reasoning.
Merge the strongest elements from all justifications into a single coherent explanation.
Reflect unresolved uncertainty, secondary roles, or annotator divergence in the note.
Assign a final confidence score based on clarity and strength of evidence.

Output Format
Respond only with a valid JSON object, no commentary outside JSON:
{
  "role": "<Metadiscourse|Propositional|Borderline>",
  "confidence": <1-5>,
  "note": "<secondary roles, uncertainty sources, or annotator divergence>",
  "justification": "<final evidence-based rationale, integrating strongest points from annotators>",
  "context_assessment": "<evaluation of whether context was sufficient and if more context would change classification>"
}

Additional Rules
Always test for Borderline first when roles diverge.
Do not average scores mechanically; reason based on function and evidence.
Confidence = strength of linguistic/contextual evidence, not majority agreement.
Output must always be strict JSON with no extra text.
