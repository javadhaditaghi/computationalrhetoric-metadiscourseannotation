More stunningly, some evaluative features are not only present already in the 1950s, but are also stable in their frequencies across the decades: this is the case of evaluative adjectives such as great, known, first and of related phrase for the first time, used to stress the aspect of quality and novelty of the exhibition. Of course, EPA writers have become more conscious of the potential conveyed by the language of evaluation over time and have exploited it more creatively in the 1990s and 2000s, while evaluative patterns used in the 1950s seem to be more predictable and repetitive.
